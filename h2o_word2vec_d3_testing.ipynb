Bad business all around on this one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            </td></tr>\n",

They do not develop that nasty smell like some dog treats do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </td></tr>\n",

       "<tr><td>I am always looking for healthier, whole grain versions of foods I enjoy.  Unfortunately, these Peacock brand noodles are yet another food masquerading as healthy.  The product title in big letters on the front says \"Brown Rice Vermicelli\", making the consumer think \"this is made with brown rice, so it should be a healthy choice\".  But the first indication that it is not is when looking at the fiber content on the nutrition facts - only 0.6g per 2oz serving.  Then onto the ingredients list to see why so low... contains brown rice, sago starch and water.  The sago starch comes from palms and must not have much (if any) fiber.<br /><br />The Annie Chun's Maifun Brown Rice Noodles (sold on Amazon and in my local healthy grocer) has become one of my staples and is my frame of reference when comparing to the Peacock brand.  The Annie Chun's product is made with 100% whole grain, with ingredients brown rice flour and water.  Per 2oz serving, it has 4g fiber and pretty much the same calories and other nutrients as the Peacock brand.<br /><br />If you do try this Peacock brand noodles and have not used rice noodles before, you will need to seek guidance elsewhere on preparation.  As others have pointed out, the Peacock package gives almost no directions on how to prepare the product, aside from a brief mention in the recipes (in the header text it does say that they are \"easy-to-cook\" but does not say how).  It also contains a very strange recipe for rice noodles: Aglio Olio style - this is an Italian recipe for noodles with olive oil/garlic/sprinkled with grated cheese that I think would not be very tasty.  The second recipe appears to be for a soup with veggie strips.  Neither recipe gives amounts or much direction.  In comparison, the Annie Chun's package gives clear, specific directions on rice noodle preparation and two recipes.<br /><br />I use rice noodles = maifun = rice sticks = sometimes called vermicelli for making the Vietnamese salad \"bun tofu\", to serve with stir-fried veggies or in lettuce rolls.  They can also be used in spring rolls/egg rolls.  When cooking with thin rice noodles, be careful not to oversoak/overcook/overmix or they tend to disintegrate.  Asian rice noodle vermicelli (maifun) are not the same as Italian vermicelli and are not readily interchangeable.  If making an Italian recipe, the best results would be expected from Italian pasta and not maifun.<br /><br />A few final notes...  Both Peacock and Annie Chun's brown rice noodles are gluten free.  The Peacock is made in Singapore and the Annie Chun's in Thailand.  The Peacock noodles do taste fine (kind of bland), but so do the Annie Chun's.  At this time, they are both approximately the same price.  Peacock come in an plastic bag with some noodle crushage upon shipping; Annie Chun's are perfect upon removal from their cellophane bag in a box.  Overall, I highly recommend the Annie Chun's Maifun as a healthier option over the Peacock brand.  On a related note, the Annie Chun's soba and brown rice pad thai noodles are also excellent.<br /><br />Rating for this product: 2.5 stars rounded down to 2 stars.</td></tr>\n",

It does not have the after taste of the sweetener and I really like it, it is pretty strong, so I use a big water bottle (20 oz) for one tube, it still a little stronger than I like, but it is just my taste.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     </td></tr>\n",

Bad business all around on this one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            </td></tr>\n",

Unfortunately, these Peacock brand noodles are yet another food masquerading as healthy.  The product title in big letters on the front says \"Brown Rice Vermicelli\", making the consumer think \"this is made with brown rice, so it should be a healthy choice\".  But the first indication that it is not is when looking at the fiber content on the nutrition facts - only 0.6g per 2oz serving.  Then onto the ingredients list to see why so low... contains brown rice, sago starch and water.  The sago starch comes from palms and must not have much (if any) fiber.<br /><br />The Annie Chun's Maifun Brown Rice Noodles (sold on Amazon and in my local healthy grocer) has become one of my staples and is my frame of reference when comparing to the Peacock brand.  The Annie Chun's product is made with 100% whole grain, with ingredients brown rice flour and water.  Per 2oz serving, it has 4g fiber and pretty much the same calories and other nutrients as the Peacock brand.<br /><br />If you do try this Peacock brand noodles and have not used rice noodles before, you will need to seek guidance elsewhere on preparation.  As others have pointed out, the Peacock package gives almost no directions on how to prepare the product, aside from a brief mention in the recipes (in the header text it does say that they are \"easy-to-cook\" but does not say how).  It also contains a very strange recipe for rice noodles: Aglio Olio style - this is an Italian recipe for noodles with olive oil/garlic/sprinkled with grated cheese that I think would not be very tasty.  The second recipe appears to be for a soup with veggie strips.  Neither recipe gives amounts or much direction.  In comparison, the Annie Chun's package gives clear, specific directions on rice noodle preparation and two recipes.<br /><br />I use rice noodles = maifun = rice sticks = sometimes called vermicelli for making the Vietnamese salad \"bun tofu\", to serve with stir-fried veggies or in lettuce rolls.  They can also be used in spring rolls/egg rolls.  When cooking with thin rice noodles, be careful not to oversoak/overcook/overmix or they tend to disintegrate.  Asian rice noodle vermicelli (maifun) are not the same as Italian vermicelli and are not readily interchangeable.  If making an Italian recipe, the best results would be expected from Italian pasta and not maifun.<br /><br />A few final notes...  Both Peacock and Annie Chun's brown rice noodles are gluten free.  The Peacock is made in Singapore and the Annie Chun's in Thailand.  The Peacock noodles do taste fine (kind of bland), but so do the Annie Chun's.  At this time, they are both approximately the same price.  Peacock come in an plastic bag with some noodle crushage upon shipping; Annie Chun's are perfect upon removal from their cellophane bag in a box.  Overall, I highly recommend the Annie Chun's Maifun as a healthier option over the Peacock brand.  On a related note, the Annie Chun's soba and brown rice pad thai noodles are also excellent.<br /><br />Rating for this product: 2.5 stars rounded down to 2 stars.</td></tr>\n",
